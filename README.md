# PFA Phonotactic Learner

This project was my attempt at implementing a relative frequency based phonotactic learner using DFAs. I conducted experiments using the same data as the https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/amphonology/article/view/5173/4840 paper.

To replicate the experiments, this repo requires the following to be installed:

- python3.6+
- pyfoma
- numpy

Run the cells in `learner.ipynb` to see the results.
